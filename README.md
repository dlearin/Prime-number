# Prime-number
Program that shows only the first three two-digit numbers entered in the prompt box

Program that requests 2 numbers through prompt windows. The program shows the first 3 prime numbers included in the range of the numbers entered.

For example: If we enter a 5 as the first number and a 20 as the second number, the program must show the first 3 prime numbers between 5 and 20, that is, “5 7 11”.

Includes the “break” statement.
